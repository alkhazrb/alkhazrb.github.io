<p>Our research aims to understand blood flow behaviour in healthy aging, exercise, and across disease states.</p>
<p>We focus on: 1) micro- and macro-vascular network topology, morphology, and function in peripheral and cerebral vascular beds, 2) investigating relationships between cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function in healthy and at-risk populations, and relationships between vascular function and cognitive outcomes, 3) AI-based (i.e., machine and deep learning) approaches to vascular imaging. We use multi-modal approaches (e.g., duplex and transcranial Doppler ultrasound, MRI, functional near infra-red spectroscopy with diffusion correlation spectroscopy, pupillometry) to better visualize and assess vascular responses to various stimuli.</p>
