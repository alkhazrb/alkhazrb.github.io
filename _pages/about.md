Our research lab focuses on local and systemic hemodynamics, clinical populations and vascular-related comorbidities, and exercise physiology. The growing technical areas of interest in the lab include automating medical image analysis, advanced statistical approaches (e.g., machine learning), and application of AI methods to vascular research. Please see our ["Research"] (https://www.alkhazrb/github.io/research/) tab to learn more.

Dr. Baraa K. Al-Khazraji is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Kinesiology](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/kinesiology/ "Dept. of Kinesiology, McMaster University"), [Faculty of Science](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/ "Faculty of Science, McMaster University"), McMaster University. Baraa received her Doctorate of Medical Biophysics in the microvascular control from Western University, and her postdoctoral training in Kinesiology in the area of integrative cardiovascular and cerebrovascular control. 
 
Baraa teaches upper level courses in Kinesiology focused on integrative cardiovascular physiology, cardiopathophysiology, and introductory hemodynamic data analysis.
