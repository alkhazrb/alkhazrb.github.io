<p>Our research aims to understand blood flow behaviour in healthy aging, exercise, and across disease states.</p>
<p>We focus on: 1) micro- and macro-vascular network topology, morphology, and function in peripheral and cerebral vascular beds, 2) investigating relationships between cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function in healthy and at-risk populations, and relationships between vascular function and cognitive outcomes, 3) AI-based (i.e., machine and deep learning) approaches to vascular imaging. We use multi-modal approaches (e.g., duplex and transcranial Doppler ultrasound, MRI, functional near infra-red spectroscopy with diffusion correlation spectroscopy, pupillometry) to better visualize and assess vascular responses to various stimuli.</p>

<h3>Current/recent projects in the lab (last updated Jan. 29, 2021):</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Characterizing cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease risk in older adults and osteoarthritis patients</li> 
  <li>Characterizing cerebrovascular dysfunction in cardiac patients</li>
  <li>Micro- and macrovascular vascular network feature analyses</li>
  <li>Automation of cerebrovascular imaging analyses</li>
  <li>Cerebrovascular segmentation and classification from MRI images</li>
  <li>Large-scale physiological testing online</li>
</ul> 

<p>  </p>

 </ul>
<p>  </p>
Students interested in applying can send their CV, unofficial transcripts, and a letter of interest to Dr. Al-Khazraji.
<p>  </p>
Dr. Al-Khazraji will contact the top candidates for an interview and the selected candidates will then be asked to apply to the McMaster University Department of Kinesiology Graduate Program.
