<p>Our research aims to understand blood flow control with healthy aging, across disease states, and during short or long-term exercise training.</p>
<p>Some of our current and growing research interests include:</p> 
<ol>1) micro- and macro-vascular network topology, morphology, and function in peripheral and cerebral vascular beds</ol> 
<ol>2) investigating relationships between cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function in healthy and at-risk populations, and relationships between vascular function and cognitive outcomes</ol> 
<ol>3) AI-based (i.e., machine and deep learning) approaches to micro- and macrovascular imaging </ol>
We have the capacity to use multi-modal approaches (e.g., duplex and transcranial Doppler ultrasound, MRI, functional near-infrared spectroscopy with diffusion correlation spectroscopy, pupillometry) to better visualize, characterize and assess physiological responses to various stimuli.</p>

<h3>Ongoing projects in the lab (last updated Jan. 2021):</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Characterizing cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease risk in older adults and at-risk populations (e.g., osteoarthritis patients)</li> 
  <li>Characterizing cerebrovascular function in cardiac patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation</li>
  <li>Micro- and macrovascular vascular network feature analyses</li>
  <li>Automation of cerebrovascular imaging analyses</li>
  <li>Cerebrovascular segmentation and classification from MRI images</li>
  <li>Large-scale physiological testing online</li>
</ul> 

We are very grateful to have received national funding to support our ongoing research and to establish an integrative research lab with infrastructure that supports questions related to understanding hemodynamics in health and disease.
